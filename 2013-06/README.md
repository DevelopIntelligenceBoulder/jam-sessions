Jam Session meeting, June 2013
==========================================

Agenda
------
- Introduction, discuss locations and future meetings
- Code Kata: Writing a Quicksort (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
- Project/Tutorial: Google I/O Hackathon project (https://github.com/sagepath/io-hackathon-2013)

Meeting Notes
-------------
- We waited a little while to start as traffic was bad and people were trying to find the new location.
- JR did a quick introduction for newcomers, acknowledged Sagepath's hospitality for hosting us, and announced a few job openings Sagepath had available.
- JR explained the concept of a Code Kata as a means of practicing and honing coding skills, in the same way a musician or a martial artist might.  
- We began doing our Quicksort Code Kata and discussed briefly how one might first write just a functional sort based on the Wikipedia pseudo-code, then later attempt it again based on just memory, then later perhaps try a variant or a more optimized implementation, or try to ensure a more Pythonic style of implementation.  Each iteration of implementation is an attempt to reinforce good practices and improve the implementation.
- Most people seemed to agree the Code Katas were a good idea and that we should continue doing them as a warm-up at future meetings.
- We then switched to working on the Google IO Hackathon project.  JR briefly introduced the project and explained the process of forking the repository and setting up your local repository to be able to contribute back to the upstream repository.
- There was discussion on improving the project by using a Twitter API module rather than URL construction, how to store API keys and deploy them to AppEngine without including them in source control, and how we might best use the Datastore as a caching mechanism.
- Most of the group left at around 9:30, with a few staying til around 10:15.
