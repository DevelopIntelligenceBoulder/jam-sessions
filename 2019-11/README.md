This month's session includes a few basic files and built-in tests.

## Introduction

December is only a few weeks away! And with December comes the Advent... of code!

[Advent of Code][aoc] is a yearly event organized by Eric Wastl, where a programming puzzle is published every day from December 1st through December 25th. It will run for the fifth time this year.

Its puzzles are fun, interesting, and all excellently written. This month we will look at a few of them. The instructions and input are reproduced here for convenience, along with some tips. But feel free to work from the official website if you wish.

#### More about Advent of Code

The preferred way to participate is to create an account on [the website][aoc]: puzzle inputs are individually generated, consequently each contestant will be submitting a different answer. The game is also a competition, ranking players by speed. 

But nobody's forcing you to compete. All puzzles are available online without the need to create an account. They are great challenges and a good learning tool! The problems can also be solved using any language; doing Advent of Code problems multiple times with different languages is an excellent way to learn and appreciate the strengths and particularities of each.

**Warning:** while the first few puzzles of each year are generally quite easy, the difficulty gets much steeper over time. If you're a beginner, puzzles from the second week onwards will likely be very challenging.
