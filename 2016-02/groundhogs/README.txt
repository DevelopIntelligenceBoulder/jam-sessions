Historical predictions by Punxsutany Phil Groundhog provided in this repo.


Using the archives of historical Groundhog predictions, can you determine how accurate the Groundhog is?  Use the public data available from the NOAA to examine the weather over time, such as the mean temperature data linked above.

Questions to Consider:

1)  What does "Early Spring" vs. "Longer Winter" mean?  (average temperatures, diff between high and low, trend of temperatures over time, etc)

2)  Should the region the groundhog is in be considered for his predictions?  (ex. Can Georgia's General Lee predict the weather for the nation?  Just the Southeast?)

3)  Is there another way to interpret the weather that makes the groundhog more accurate? (Trends instead of temperature values, for instance)
