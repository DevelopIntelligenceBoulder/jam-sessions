# Easy puzzle: 1202 Program Alarm

From Advent of Code 2019, Day 2: <https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2>

Write your code in `puzzle_2.py`. The functions `part_1` and `part_2` will automatically be run when you click the "test" button. The `data` argument will hold the contents of the `puzzle_2.txt` file _as text_. You are free to create other functions, but don't rename or delete `part_1` and `part_2`.

### Part 1

On the way to your [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a "[1202 program alarm](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html#1023832)". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly normaâ€”" The ship computer [bursts into flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire).

You notify the Elves that the computer's [magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) seems to have escaped. "That computer ran **Intcode** programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"

An Intcode program is a list of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) separated by commas (like `1,0,0,3,99`). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position `0`). Here, you will find an _opcode_ - either `1`, `2`, or `99`. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, `99` means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.

Opcode `1` _adds_ together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers _immediately after_ the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the _positions_ from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the _position_ at which the output should be stored.

For example, if your Intcode computer encounters `1,10,20,30`, it should read the values at positions `10` and `20`, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position `30` with their sum.

Opcode `2` works exactly like opcode `1`, except it _multiplies_ the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate _where_ the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

Once you're done processing an opcode, _move to the next one_ by stepping forward 4 positions.

For example, suppose you have the following program:

    1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50

For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:

    1,9,10,3,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

The first four integers, `1,9,10,3`, are at positions `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. Together, they represent the first opcode (`1`, addition), the positions of the two inputs (`9` and `10`), and the position of the output (`3`). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position `9` contains `30`, and position `10` contains `40`. Add these numbers together to get `70`. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (`3`) is at position `3`, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:

    1,9,10,70,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, `2`. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions `3` and `11`; these positions contain `70` and `50` respectively. Multiplying these produces `3500`; this is stored at position `0`:
 
    3500,9,10,70,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode `99`, halting the program.

Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

- `1,0,0,0,99` becomes `2,0,0,0,99` (`1 + 1 = 2`).
- `2,3,0,3,99` becomes `2,3,0,6,99` (`3 * 2 = 6`).
- `2,4,4,5,99,0` becomes `2,4,4,5,99,9801` (`99 * 99 = 9801`).
- `1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99` becomes `30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99`.

Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input in `puzzle_2.txt`) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the program, replace position `1` with the value `12` and replace position `2` with the value `2`. **What value is left at position `0`** after the program halts?

### Part 2

"[...] We're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to **determine what pair of inputs produces the output `19690720`**."

The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses `1` and `2`, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address `1` is called the _noun_, and the value placed in address `2` is called the _verb_. Each of the two input values will be between `0` and `99`, inclusive.

Once the program has halted, its output is available at address `0`, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.

Find the input _noun_ and _verb_ that cause the program to produce the output `19690720`. **What is `100 * noun + verb`?** (For example, if `noun=12` and `verb=2`, the answer would be `1202`.)
