- Python Challenge warmup exercise, Level 12: http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/evil.html
If prompted for a login, use u:huge, p:file
- Discuss / do a tutorial on Twisted.

Meeting Notes:
- Due to issues with internet access, we had trouble doing the Python Challenge Exercise, so we may make another attempt next month.
- We briefly dicussed Twisted, which can be found at http://www.twistedmatrix.com.  To use it, you can simply do "pip install twisted" if using pip, or download the Windows binaries.  Some of us went through the initial tutorial found here: http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/servers.html
- We had some newcomers who wanted to know about good places to start with Python and programming, and specifically game programming.  Some suggestions made are listed below:
    - PyGame: one of the most popular Python Gaming libraries. http://www.pygame.org
    - Unity: a popular game engine, especially for mobile game development. http://unity3d.com
    - Coursera: Online university courses.  There are several beginning programming courses and game programming courses are offered.  http://www.coursera.org
    - Udacity: Another online course offering. http://www.udacity.com
    - Open CourseWare: Open access to course materials from schools like MIT, Stanford, etc. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare
    - Python Challenge: A set of puzzles starting from a beginner level and gradually getting more complex. http://www.pythonchallenge.com
    - Project Euler: A set of mathematics-oriented puzzles solvable via programming.  This is not Python-specific, but the problems should all be solvable via Python. http://projecteuler.net/
