Jam Session meeting, June 2013
==========================================

Agenda
------
- Introduction, discuss locations and future meetings
- Code Kata: Tic Tac Toe
    - How do you represent the board?
    - How do you determine when someone has won the game, and who?
    - Given any board state, how do you determine if the game is still going, or is in a completed state? (Win, Draw)
    - Would you change anything about the way you represented the data if your client was a GUI, or a website, rather than the command line?
    - Are there any shorter / faster ways to determine if an incomplete game cannot be won, no matter which moves are made next?

- Project/Tutorial: Google I/O Hackathon project (https://github.com/sagepath/io-hackathon-2013)
